<p style="font-size20px;text-align:left;line-height:1.1;">I am a senior machine learning engineer at delphai, a company creating business intelligence via AI technologies and large-scale text data. My interests lie in natural language processing (NLP), NLP for social media, AI for social good and Explainable AI. <br>

Previously, I was a postdoctoral researcher in <a href="https://sentic.net/" target="_blank">Sentic Team</a> at Nanyang Technological University and at the University of Sheffield in the UK. I obtained my PhD degree in computer science from the University of Sheffield under the supervision of <a href="https://staffwww.dcs.shef.ac.uk/people/F.Ciravegna/Fabio_Ciravegna/About.html" target="_blank">Prof. Fabio Ciravegna</a>. I researched the characterisation of rumours and their spreading on social media and rumour detection in the early stages of the diffusion of real-world events.</p>
