I am a postdoctoral research fellow in Sentic Team at Nanyang Technological University.

My interests lie in natural language processing (NLP), NLP for social media, AI for social good and Explainable AI.

Previsouly, I was a research associate at the Univeristy of Sheffield in the UK. I obtained my PhD degree in computer science from the University of Sheffield under the supervision of Prof. Fabio Ciravegna. I researched the characterisation of rumours and their spreading on social media and rumour detection in the early stages of the diffusion of real-world events.
