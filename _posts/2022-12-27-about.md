<p style="font-size:20px;text-align:left;line-height:1.1;font-weight:300">I am a senior machine learning engineer at <a href="https://www.intapp.com/" target="_blank">Intapp</a>. </p>
 
<p style="font-size:20px;text-align:left;line-height:1.1;font-weight:300">My interests lie in natural language processing (NLP), neuro-symbolic AI, AI for social good, and explainable AI.</p>

<p style="font-size:20px;text-align:left;line-height:1.1;font-weight:300">Previously, I worked as a senior machine learning engineer at Delphai, a Berlin-based startup focused on business intelligence through AI technologies and large-scale firmographic data. Before joining the corporate world, I was a postdoctoral researcher in <a href="https://sentic.net/" target="_blank">Sentic Team</a> at Nanyang Technological University and at the University of Sheffield in the UK. I obtained my PhD degree in computer science from the University of Sheffield under the supervision of <a href="https://www.di.unito.it/~ciravegna/Home.html" target="_blank">Prof. Fabio Ciravegna</a>. My doctoral research focused on  characterising and detecting rumours and their spread on social media during the early stages of real-world events.</p>
